          ASHUTOSH MARINE recognizes the vessel performance and management of risk depend upon the effective selection and retention of competent staff.
          Crew management covers a broad range of activities including the recruitment, selection, placement, training and management of officers and ratings employed on our managed vessels. Travel services and payroll management are also an integral part of a crew management activity.

          We select well-qualified personnel to work on a diverse range of vessels including all type of tankers, gas carriers, container carriers, Ro-Ro ships, dry cargo vessels, bulk carriers, AHT, supply vessels and specialized vessels. Our current database of marine specialists allows us to react quickly to any request from ship owner/manager.
